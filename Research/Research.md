"[Households’ Expenditure Commitments: Formation, Adjustment to Income Shocks, and Aggregate Demand]"

<p align="justify">
<sub>
This project studies how households’ fixed expenditure commitments shape their ability to adjust consumption following income shocks. Using microdata from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) and bank account data, I document who commits to fixed expenditures, why commitment levels differ across households, and how commitments affect adjustment margins after income shocks.

I then develop a heterogeneous-agent incomplete-markets model with two motives for expenditure commitments: an insurance motive and a long-term investment motive. The model replicates the empirical patterns observed in the data and allows me to quantify how commitment levels shape precautionary savings, consumption responses to income shocks, aggregate demand, and welfare.

The framework highlights when households become particularly exposed to risk and identifies circumstances under which targeted fiscal interventions can deliver strong welfare and stabilization gains.
