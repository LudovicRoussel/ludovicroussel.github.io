I am a 3rd year PhD Candidate in economics at the European University Institute (EUI), under the supervision of **[Alexander Ludwig](https://alexander-ludwig.com/)** (EUI) and **[Alexander Monge-Naranjo](https://alexandermonge.com/)** (FED Atlanta).

My research lies at the intersection of **household finance, macroeconomics, and public policy**. I am currently working on projects on expenditure commitments and adjustment to income shocks, households expenditure risk, as well as intergenerational income risk and savings behavior.
